![Description of the GIF](transition2.gif)

## Summary

This project aims to develop a "species" of miniaturized robots (1-2 cm) capable of learning, adapting, and transmitting knowledge autonomously within a real physical environment. Inspired by anthropology and simulation games like **_The Sims_** and **_Spore_**, these robots are designed with a simple objective: **maximize their survival time**. Each robot starts with minimal pre-programmed knowledge and learns through experience how to satisfy its needs, interact with others, and adapt to changing conditions.

Key features include:

- **Survival-Driven Behavior Development**: Each robot only knows it gains "points" by maximizing its survival time, and everything else—such as finding "food," "resting," and social behaviors—will be learned through reinforcement learning over time.
- **Accumulate Intergenerational Knowledge**: Transfer experiences across "generations" without hardware modifications, simulating a form of artificial "genetic inheritance."
- **Interact Autonomously**: Robots operate independently of any central control system. They communicate with each other through learned signaling, simulating human-like social behaviors.
- **Augmented Reality (AR) Visualization**: AR enables immersive, real-time visualization of the robots' behavior and evolution, creating a dynamic digital ecosystem.

## Project Objectives and Innovations

### 1. Creation of an Artificial Species with Evolutionary Learning

- **Anthropological and Simulation Inspiration**: Reproduce survival behaviors and social dynamics inspired by _The Sims_ and _Spore_, implemented in autonomous physical robots.
- **Genetic Inheritance Simulation**: Use algorithms to enable autonomous robots to transfer learned behaviors and traits across generations, simulating genetic inheritance.

### 2. Knowledge Transfer Without Hardware Changes

- **Software-Centric Adaptation**: Focus on sophisticated learning and memory algorithms, allowing for adaptability solely through software improvements.
- **Intergenerational Wisdom**: Each new robot introduced into the ecosystem starts with no prior knowledge. Over time, it may acquire behaviors from experienced robots, testing the capacity for autonomous knowledge transfer.

### 3. Interactive Augmented Reality Visualization

- **Real-Time Immersive Experience**: AR will provide a contactless interface to observe and interact with the robot ecosystem in real-time.
- **User Engagement**: Observers can adjust environmental parameters and see how robots adapt to changes, demonstrating evolutionary learning.

## Addressed Gaps in the State of the Art

- **Physical Evolutionary Robotics**: Advancing from simulations to implementing evolution and inheritance in real-world autonomous robots.
- **Intergenerational Knowledge Transfer**: Developing communication protocols that allow robots to share learned behaviors without physical changes.
- **Contactless Interaction and Visualization**: Leveraging AR to offer a fully immersive, interactive observation experience.

## Unique Aspects of the Project

- **Interdisciplinary Integration**: Combines robotics, artificial intelligence, evolutionary biology, AR, and concepts from popular simulation games.
- **Educational Impact**: Makes complex scientific concepts like inheritance and evolution accessible and engaging.
- **Ethical Exploration**: Opens discussion on ethical considerations related to autonomous evolution in technology.

## Conclusion

This project represents a unique advancement in autonomous robotics by combining evolutionary principles and intergenerational knowledge transfer in physical robots, enhanced by real-time AR visualization. It contributes to science, engages educational audiences, and raises awareness on ethical implications surrounding evolving autonomous systems.
