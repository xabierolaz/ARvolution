# Co-Evolving Robotic Ecosystems with Haptic-Virtual Interaction: Touchless Learning, Adaptation, and Sociality

## Executive Summary

This project develops an ecosystem of autonomous robots that learn, adapt, interact socially, and *co-evolve* with their hybrid physical-virtual environment, *prioritizing touchless human interaction through Augmented Reality (AR)*. Inspired by artificial life (*The Sims*, *Spore*) and biology, the project combines:

1.  A high-fidelity simulation as the primary testbed.
2.  Robust reinforcement learning (DRL), imitation learning, and multi-agent learning algorithms, including AR-mediated *learning by observation*.
3.  A *spatial and haptic* AR interface enabling visualization, *precise* manipulation, and *direct interaction* with robots (including their *internal states* and *personalities*) *without physical contact*.
4.  Filtered knowledge transfer with *controlled mutations*.

We will investigate the emergence of complex behaviors (division of labor, cooperative construction, communication) and their *co-evolution* with the environment, analyzing the underlying mechanisms with interpretability techniques (XAI) and connecting them to biological/social models. *Feasibility* is maximized through a *gradual Sim-to-Real* approach, using a *robust and low-cost* robotic platform (TurtleBot 3 or similar). The goal is a *robust*, *explainable*, *adaptable*, and *social* robotic system, with significant impact on *touchless* robotics, AI, human-robot interaction, and the study of complex systems. It aligns directly with *Touchless* principles, promoting safe and efficient interaction through virtual interfaces.

## 1. Introduction and Motivation

Autonomous multi-agent systems hold enormous potential, but safe, efficient, and intuitive interaction with these systems is a crucial challenge. This project addresses this challenge by drawing inspiration from artificial life (games like *The Sims* and *Spore*) and biology (social systems, evolution), *and prioritizing touchless human interaction (Touchless)*. We create a robotic "living laboratory" where the primary interaction occurs through a *spatial and haptic* Augmented Reality (AR) interface.

From *The Sims*, we adopt *individual needs* and *social relationships* as drivers of behavior. From *Spore*, we take the idea of *evolution* (of software) and *developmental stages*. We add the *co-evolution* of the environment, where robot actions modify the environment, and the environment, in turn, influences robot learning and evolution. By combining these elements with cutting-edge robotics, reinforcement learning, and *touchless* AR interaction, we study emergent collective intelligence and develop new ways to interact with complex systems safely and efficiently.

## 2. Project Objectives
