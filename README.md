![Description of the GIF](transition2.gif)
## Summary

This project aims to develop an ecosystem of autonomous robots that can learn, adapt, and share knowledge within a real physical environment. Inspired by anthropology and simulation games like **_The Sims_** and **_Spore_**, these robots are designed to maximize their survival and adaptability. Starting with basic behaviors, each robot will use advanced reinforcement learning algorithms to discover how to meet its needs, interact with others, and adjust to changing conditions.

Key features include:

- **Survival-Driven Behavior Development**: Robots will use reinforcement learning to learn behaviors that maximize a reward function tied to survival metrics.
- **Intergenerational Knowledge Transfer**: Through peer-to-peer communication, robots will share learned behaviors, simulating "genetic inheritance" through software.
- **Autonomous Interaction**: Without central control, robots will communicate and collaborate using evolved signaling methods, leading to emergent social behaviors.
- **Augmented Reality (AR) Visualization**: Using AR platforms, we will provide real-time visualization and interaction with the robotic ecosystem.
